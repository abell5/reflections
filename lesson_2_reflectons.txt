These are my lesson 2 reflections.

Files go to the staging area, then get commited.

Use git status to see what is up.

Use git add to move to the staging area, then git commit to move to the repository.

COMMANDS:

git init:	 this will initalize the repository

git add [file]:  this moves a file from the directory to the staging area

git commit:  moves every file from the staging area to the repository.

git diff --staged:  the difference between the staging area and the repository.

git reset --hard:  discards ANY CHANGES in the working directory and staging area.  BE CAREFUL!!! YOU CANT REVERSE A RESET!
