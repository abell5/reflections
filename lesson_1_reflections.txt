In Lesson 1 I learned about the windows command "fc", which is file compare.  It will tell you the differences between two files.

Syntax:

>  fc [file1] [fil2]

Version control can be used in Dropbox, Google Docs.  Wikipedia uses version control extensively.

A *commit* is a saved version

*git diff [commit1] [commit2]* this command is like "fc" but for git diff

Commit after each bug.  You don't want that shit too big to the point where it isn't useful.


A commit is a snapshot of every file in your repository at that time.

Q:  Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A:  Because git is designed for programmers, and programmers are more likely to be working with multiple files all at  the same time.x`


Use *clone [url]" to clone a github repository to your local drive

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A: Use log to see the list, and use git diff to compare to each other

-git checkout [commit_id] will make the listed commit the head version

-HEAD is the current version you are on

Q:  How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A:  Easy, I can always go back to checkout and retrive my shit

A: You can use git log to show the commit history and git diff to compare across different versions.

-*HEAD* is what git calls the version you are currently working on

-*git checkout* is similiar to restoring.  Changing all your files to the way they were

A: git log will list all changes the the file, and then git diff allows you to compare across versions.


***The second arguemnet in git diff is the new file, and the new lines from that file will be shown as additions.
